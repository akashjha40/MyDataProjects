My Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains several data science and machine learning projects that I have completed while learning statistics, machine learning, model evaluation, and real-world data analysis. Each project focuses on understanding the data, applying the right methods, and explaining results clearly.

Project 1: National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) Dataset Analysis
Date: April 2025
This project examines how bullying, sleep quality, and parental mental health influence a child's overall mental well-being. I used the official National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) dataset and performed statistical analysis including probability, relative risk, and odds ratios. The analysis was done in Python using Pandas. The goal was to understand important factors affecting children's mental health and highlight the importance of early support.

Project 2: Car Price Prediction
Date: June 2024
I built a regression model to predict car prices using features such as engine specifications, horsepower, mileage, and more. The model achieved an R-squared score of 0.88. I used Linear Regression, feature engineering, VIF, RFE, and StatsModels to refine and tune the model. This project helped me understand how numeric features influence pricing and how to build reliable regression models.

Project 3: Digit Classifier using SVM
Date: May 2025
This project involves building a handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST dataset. I used a Support Vector Machine with an RBF kernel to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the images. This project strengthened my understanding of kernel methods, image classification, and high-dimensional data.

Project 4: Heart Disease Classifier
Date: February 2025
I created a Random Forest Classifier to predict chronic heart disease in suspected patients and achieved 97 percent accuracy. I used Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning, SMOTE for handling imbalanced data, and evaluated the model using precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and a confusion matrix. This project helped me understand how to work with sensitive medical data where correct classification is critical.

Project 5: NGO Clustering Project
Date: January 2025
I used K-Means clustering to divide countries into meaningful groups based on GDP per capita, health spending, life expectancy, child mortality, income levels, and other development indicators. The purpose was to help an NGO identify which countries need aid the most. This project gave me hands-on experience with unsupervised learning and interpreting real-world socioeconomic patterns.
